# Mapping out the energy space

A quick foreword‚ÄîI‚Äôm an AI guy and I use it for lots of things.

While I don‚Äôt like to use it for writing, as it tends to create voiceless and untrustworthy text, it does one thing REALLY well‚Ä¶.

Claude helped me to brainstorm the list (which I heavily curated and modified) that I‚Äôm using as my roadmap for understanding the energy market as a whole.

## Why did I write this?

The AI world has a lot of mania at the time of this writing, and as a ‚Äúcareer AI guy,‚Äù it is essential to understand the underlying forces that help drive (or kill üíÄ) the growth of the AI bubble.

Alongside the mega-minds and hype men, the AI industry requires many ingredients such as computational power, infrastructure capabilities, and power generation.

I don‚Äôt know much about how the energy space works as a whole, but I do know that AI requires a lot of it. How much specifically?

> AI servers could use 0.5% of the world‚Äôs electrical generation by 2027. For context, data centers currently use around 1% of global electrical generation‚Ä¶ this suggests an electricity consumption of approximately 3 Wh per LLM interaction.

Cell Press. (2023). Joule, Volume 7, Issue 7. Retrieved from [https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(23)00365-3](https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(23)00365-3)

While writing this article, I made at least 100 LLM interactions, using about 300 Wh, so for context my AI usage was about the equivalent to a 10-watt LED light bulb running for 30 hours.

Most importantly‚ÄîI can't fix a problem that spans such a wide range of areas. Focusing on a specific issue in a specific industry could lead to a solvable stepping stone and better understanding the market forces as a whole!

## Understanding the energy sub-sectors and breaking them down into clusters

I‚Äôm currently clustering sub-sectors into three primary categories:

- energy generation ($4-5 trillion market cap)
    - Fossil Fuels: ~110,500 TWh (65%)
        - Coal: ~44,200 TWh (40% of fossil fuels)
        - Natural Gas: ~38,675 TWh (35% of fossil fuels)
        - Oil: ~27,625 TWh (25% of fossil fuels)
    - Renewable Energy: ~46,000 TWh (27%)
        - Hydropower: ~18,400 TWh (40% of renewables)
        - Wind: ~9,200 TWh (20% of renewables)
        - Solar: ~7,360 TWh (16% of renewables)
        - Biomass: ~6,900 TWh (15% of renewables)
        - Geothermal: ~3,680 TWh (8% of renewables)
        - Tidal/Wave: ~460 TWh (1% of renewables)
    - Nuclear Energy: ~13,500 TWh (8%)
- energy storage  ($2-3 trillion market cap)
    - short-term storage solutions ($350-400 billion market cap)
    - long-term storage solutions ($150-200 billion market cap)
- energy transmission ($50-100 billion market cap)

The following have been grouped into tangential categories with significant influence on the energy space as a whole:

- energy markets and trading
- energy policy and regulation:
- energy data and analytics:
- sustainability and environmental impact:

This follows a relatively intuitive flow: man generates energy ‚Üí man stores some of that energy ‚Üí man moves around and uses some of that energy.

I'll outline the roadmap in this article and then delve into each of the sub-sectors in separate articles, as each represents multiple billion-dollar industries.

For example, the energy generation sub-sector includes fuel sources, methods of refinement, and utilization per fuel source (too much to detail here).

The following diagram represents the three primary categories defined above in a sunburst chart, with the size of each chunk representing its market cap relative to the energy space as a whole (roughly estimated to be seven trillion dollars for this example).

# Define the data

    "Energy",
    "Generation", "Storage", "Transmission",
    "Fossil", "Renewable", "Nuclear",

    "Oil","Gas","Coal",
    "Lithium-ion batteries", "Supercapacitors", "Pumped hydro storage", "Compressed Air Energy Storage",

# Update values to represent market share (these are example values, adjust as needed)
values = [
    100,  # Energy (total)
    69, 30, 1,  # Generation, Storage, Transmission
    65, 27, 8,  # Fossil, Renewable, Nuclear
    12.5, 37.5,  # Short-term, Long-term
    7, 2.5, 2.5,  # Grid Infrastructure, Efficiency, Energy Conversion
    16, 20, 40, 8, 15, 1,  # Solar, Wind, Hydro, Geothermal, Biomass, Tidal
    25, 35, 45,  # Oil, Gas, Coal
    38.5, 1.5, 12.5, 2.5,  # Lithium-ion, Supercapacitors, Pumped hydro, Compressed Air
    22.5, 12.5, 12.5, 2.5,  # Hydrogen, Flow batteries, Power-to-Gas, Cryogenic
]

# Create the sunburst chart
fig = go.Figure(go.Sunburst(
    labels=labels,
    parents=parents,
    values=values,
))

# Update the layout
fig.update_layout(
    title="Energy Sector Sunburst Chart",
    width=800,
    height=800,
)

# Show the chart
fig.show()
```


The final child nodes of the sunburst were calculated by estimating how much of the global 170,000 TWh (terawatt-hours) each energy source contributed.

I‚Äôll be focusing on the tangential markets in a later post.

# Initial takeaways

I was surprised to see that energy generation had such a large share of the overall energy market. It makes sense that resources used to produce energy would play a substantial role, but I didn‚Äôt anticipate that the majority of energy would be utilized (or perhaps lost) before storage and transmission played a bigger role.

- Note to self for future investigation üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äîbetter understand how much energy gets lost before it even leaves the building‚Ä¶

Hydro energy being the largest of the renewables by a significant factor was also surprising. Regions of the country with large rivers and waterfalls produce disproportionate amounts of energy compared to their usage!

I also had no idea that you could store energy by essentially pumping or compressing resources like water and air for future kinetic gains (a spicy physics trick üå∂Ô∏è).

I‚Äôd like to see how market growth in each sector compares to better understand which has potential for expansion and which has stagnated. Energy policy plays a large role in what succeeds and what doesn't.

At least I now have a general understanding, even if imperfect, of how market forces interact and their relative sizes.

I will now begin a deep dive into each slice of the sunburst chart to understand how the process works, where it falls short, and the ongoing innovations and initiatives to build on it.

If I had to throw a dart at the dartboard to understand where AI could play a role in energy, I‚Äôd land on the following areas:

- grid management
    - optimizing mixed storage types and methods for grid utilization
- improvements to energy methods
    - Predictive modeling for optimal charge/discharge cycles
- energy efficiency optimizations
    - industrial process energy efficiency
    - Developing smart control systems for buildings and appliances
    - general energy conversions / generation AI modeling
- Optimization of storage system operations
- predictive maintenance
- predictive modeling of energy consumption patterns (storage and conversion impacts)
- market forecasting

Not too imaginative or specific yet! I see AI as the ultimate prediction tool that can find ways to move molecules from point A to point B in unexpected ways.
