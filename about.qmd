## ðŸ‘‹

Hi and welcome to the ogjaylowe blog! 

I first created this as a way to organize and share my learnings with the wider world. Check out my [first post for more details on what I'm aiming to achieve with my writing](./posts/The Sovereign Tech Dad/index.qmd).

Recently, I'm moving away from some of my older content and as a result have temporarily removed all of my previous AI content as I focus on a potentially bigger issue--how we provide the energy needed to train models!

I'm currently a Solutions Engineer at Bifrost.ai and am deeply embedded into the synthetic data space (pun intended).

## Previous work

As the first member of the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) Field Engineering team, I was instrumental in growing the team to four plus members and establishing the foundation for the wider solutions engineering team.

I drove customer growth and expansion, while making valuable engineering contributions to the wider customer base. In the last two quarters of 22' I generated ~400k in expansion based new revenue.

## Outside of work

When not working, I focus on building a great family, training in the gym, and supporting my wife's bakery.
