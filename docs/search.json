    "text": "Why bandits?\nRL agents use evaluation methods to dictate what actions it takes, instead of instruction from a combination of loss/reward/etc. functions.\nGuiding an RL agent through evaluative feedback will help it understand which actions provide the most reward but doesn’t specify which action provides the best or worst outcomes.\nBandits allow us to create simple test beds for training RL agents in. An RL agent must learn to maximize total reward when interacting with the bandit given a number of action selections.\nIf your bandit has three arms and the RL agent can choose to pull one of those three levers 1000 times–which combination of lever pulls will lead to the highest possible reward? An effective RL agent should learn the optimal sequence of when and which levers to pull."

An RL agent must learn to maximize total reward when interacting with the bandit given a number of action selections.\nIf your bandit has three arms and the RL agent can choose to pull one of those three levers 1000 times–which combination of lever pulls will lead to the highest possible reward? An effective RL agent should learn the optimal sequence of when and which levers to pull."

An RL agent must learn to maximize total reward when interacting with the bandit given a number of action selections.\nIf your bandit has three arms and the RL agent can choose to pull one of those three levers 1000 times–which combination of lever pulls will lead to the highest possible reward? An effective RL agent should learn the optimal sequence of when and which levers to pull."

An RL agent must learn to maximize total reward when interacting with the bandit given a number of action selections.\nIf your bandit has three arms and the RL agent can choose to pull one of those three levers 1000 times–which combination of lever pulls will lead to the highest possible reward? An effective RL agent should learn the optimal sequence of when and which levers to pull."

An RL agent must learn to maximize total reward when interacting with the bandit given a number of action selections.\nIf your bandit has three arms and the RL agent can choose to pull one of those three levers 1000 times–which combination of lever pulls will lead to the highest possible reward?

Some might say it was a match made in heaven. In fact, 3000 BCE was the beginning of serious river fuckery—but honestly we’ve probably been doing it for longer than that!\n\nHydroelectric powerplants are the most efficient means of producing electric energy.

    "text": "Differentiating types of hydroelectric power generation\nFossil fuels, renewable, and fusion energy sources all play a role in the nations energy portfolio, but in Idaho—around 43% of of the energy generated comes from hydroelectric facilities (5th highest in the nation)!\nFive of the ten facilities listed in Idaho’s renewable energy breakdown operate as hydroelectric dams.\nWhat might the other forms of hydroelectric generation be?\nLet’s break down the most common forms of hydroelectric power generation:\n\nHydroelectric dams: A large wall built across the width of a river, called a dam, causes a significant reservoir of water to build up. This water can be released at a controlled rate through turbines built into the dam’s structure.\n\nPumped storage facilities can use excess energy to pump water from a lower point to a higher point. This water can then be released through turbines during periods of high energy demand.\n\nRun-of-the-river hydroelectric plants: A turbine uses the natural flow of the river without creating a reservoir.\nSmall-scale hydro projects: Plants built into existing infrastructure, such as a water supply pipeline, generate electricity without a reservoir."

    "text": "Hydroelectric dam energy generation efficiency\nEnergy generation facilities maximize the output of energy while minimizing energy loss throughout the system.\nSimilar to a Costco hotdog going through the human digestive track—undesirable forces tend to ruin good times. For a dam, forces such as turbine friction and water turbulence can cause energy that could have been captured elsewhere to be lost counterproductively.\nTake a look at this diagram provided by the USGS for a better understanding of the process as a whole.\n\n\n\nFig 1 - hydro power plant diagram from USGS\n\n\n\nPotential Energy Storage: Water held in the reservoir stores potential energy due to its elevation\nPenstock: Water flows down a large pipe called the penstock, converting potential energy to kinetic energy\nTurbine: Fast-moving water spins a turbine, creating mechanical energy from the rotating turbine shaft\nGenerator: The turbine shaft spins, causing a large electromagnet inside the generator to rotate past stationary coils of wire—inducing an electric current through electromagnetic induction (converting mechanical energy to electrical energy)\nDam Transformer: Lower voltage electricity produced by the generator passes through the high voltage transformer for more efficient long-distance transmission\n\nThis step doesn’t create new energy but changes the characteristics of the electrical energy (higher voltage, lower current)\n\nTransmission Lines: High voltage electricity travels across transmission lines to substations\nSubstation Transformers: High voltage electricity passes through the low voltage transformer for distribution to local areas\nDistribution Lines: Lower voltage electricity flows directly to homes and businesses\nLocal Transformers: Transformers on power poles or in ground-level boxes further reduce the voltage for use in buildings\nApplication Usage: Homes and businesses utilize the energy in various forms (light, heat, mechanical energy in motors, etc.)\n\nTLDR spin to win baby!\n\nPublic vs private energy generation\nSimilar to any other market sector, generation of energy can be a venture owned by private, public, or government corporations. In Idaho it breaks down like this:\n\nPrivate facilities\n\nHells Canyon Complex (a collection of three facilities) = largest privately-owned conventional hydroelectric generating facility in the USA\n\nBrownlee Dam\nOxbow Dam\nHells Canyon Dam\n\nC.J. Strike Dam\nLower Salmon Falls Dam\nCabinet Gorge Dam (only one not owned by Idaho Power, but rather owned by Avista)\nBliss Dam\nUpper Salmon Falls Dam\nSwan Falls Dam\n\nPublic facilities\n\nDworshak Dam\n\nState / federal facilities\n\nPriest Lake Dam\nAmerican Falls Dam\n\n\n\n\nSomewhat unrelated but interesting facts on powers biggest “power users” in Idaho\n\n30% of power goes to industrial usage (it is the gem state after all)\n30% of power goes to transportation (Idaho has no petrolium production facilities and has rural transportation capabilities)\n24% goes to residential usage\n16% goes to commercial usage\n\nIdaho consumes 4x more power than it generates (the rest comes from natural gas imports and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) which reroutes electric energy from federal dams out-of-state). Surprisingly, Idaho still has the nation’s third-lowest average residential electricity price.\n\n\n\nFig 2 - not actually Figure 1.10\n\n\n\nIdaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources. (2021). Idaho energy landscape 2021. https://oemr.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/Idaho-Energy-Landscape-2021.pdf\n\nAs a result of this gap between consumption and production, the Pacific Northwest’s transmission capabilities becomes more congested each year as demands increase across the entire region. Solar and wind energy have the most new projects coming up in the next decade and funding has been funneled towards more.\n\n\n\nFig 3 - in-state energy production vs out-of-state energy import\n\n\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration.

    "text": "Understand how energy transmission works from a fundamental perspective\n\n\nI’ve had three conversations in the last week with colleagues on the topic of “good AI business concepts”, and each one has more-or-less gone this way:\n\nconvo starts off with “I have an idea and I’m doing x, y, and z for my minimum viable product (MVP)”\nwe outline how the MVP will solve a business case and that several other companies have done similar things in addressable markets that can be used for effective comparison\nI talk about how in my personal experience this is going to probably suck to build and it’ll suck even more to make it into a real cash cow\nwe agree that somebody out there can probably do this (so why not “me”)\nconversation ends and I’m glad that I’m not the one that has to build that MVP\n\nThe tech industry has been 10x pilled for awhile now thanks to Peter Thiel and the main spin off derivatives. I agree 100% in the framework, and that the power law exists, but I have a bone to pick with building a company that exists in the “we improve X% and rake in Y% of that as a kickback” space.\nHistory has shown us that dozens of startups emerged in the last year built the idea of creating an AI product or service for an easy 10x on some critical part of an unsexy business vertical’s core offering and that companies can indeed be founded with solid venture capital.\nSo it’s not that AI profit margin plays can’t happen—it’s that they suck to build and I don’t want to be the one that does that."

    "text": "Using AI to improve profit margins for solutions that currently exist\n\nPredictive solutions\nIn almost every aspect of the energy sector stack we see a need of predictive methods. Anything that requires maintenance could probably benefit from improved efficiency and a typical tech dashboard. I’m trying not to roll my eyes writing this one.\nAs new energy sources such as solar and wind become available, these new facilities will benefit from weather predictions impacting their generation capabilities and optimizing storage systems for fluctuations in generation windows.\nMost business cases would be along the lines of, “improve margins for X by increasing uptime, providing more stable power during peak hours, performing maintenance operations during downtime, stopping lost cash during unexpected downtime etc.”\nI would add water resource management type solutions that predict climate related variables such as water availability (snowpack + rainfall), reservoir management and irrigation, and whatever other long-term climate factors that impacts water production.\n\n\nSmarter distribution solutions\nThink anything that makes it more efficient to move or use energy in areas that need it at time of demand.\nBusiness case would be similar to predictive solutions in that users improve business margins by making sure existing capabilities get used to maximum performance.\n\n\nConsumer energy efficiency solutions\nAnything personalized or tailored to individual consumers that improves energy consumption based on their usage pattern will probably be an effective business case.\nBusiness case would be, “you save X% on your energy, feel good about being a smaller consumer, and we get some type of kickback”.\n\n\nCybersecurity improvement solutions\nEach of the regulation bodies has to deal with cybersecurity in some fashion. AI can be extremely powerful when it comes to detecting and responding to cyber threats—including vulnerability / penetration testing or simulation scenarios.\nAnother simple business case of, “we protect your shit so the American government doesn’t crash”\n\n\nRegulatory compliance and reporting solutions\nPeople don’t perform stare-and-compare actions well and AI has a great working knowledge of compliance databases.\nAnything that automates data collection or improves report generation accuracy will probably be successful.\nReal-time monitoring operations and prediction of potential compliance issues can be layered in for extra value.\nA more complex business case that can go towards improving margins through reduction of seasonal workers and/or time to compliance."
